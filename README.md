This is my code quiz! The code quiz features 6 multiple choice questions that appear one after the other once you click "Start". The questions are pulled from various topics that I have learned so far. When the quiz is over, a score is displayed along with an input box so you can type in your initials and submit them using JSON. The button submit directs you to the highscore page where, using JSON again, the initials and the score are displayed.
